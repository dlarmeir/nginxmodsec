# nginxmodsec 

## Synopsis

This GIT repository contains simple BASH scripts that I've written to automatically deploy Nginx installations with Mod_Security support.
There are two different scripts with separate installation methodologies:

nginxmodsec.sh  | nginxmodsecleg.sh
----------------|-------------------
.deb packages   | source code only
minimal effort  | needs extra work
startup scripts | no startup scripts
Ubuntu Stable   | Nginx Stable
Production	| Edgy

I'm currently writing supporting scripts that will also include the mod_security CRS as a baseline for policy.

## Installation 

``# git clone https://github.com/dlarmeir/nginxmodsec.git``
  
``# sudo su``
  
``# chmod +x nginxmodsec.sh``
  
``# sh nginxmodsec.sh``
